&nbsp;

We’ve all heard of instant offer companies, like Opendoor, who advertise quick, convenient, competitive cash offers to home sellers, but are their offers really what they claim?

I decided to go through the home sale process with Opendoor myself, and **the answer is no**.

When I went to Opendoor’s website, I submitted the required questionnaire asking for the details about the home I was selling, and a day later, I got an offer for $396,000. After that, I looked at the comparable sales they used to come up with their offer. Curiously enough, all five that they listed were over $420,000.

I then scheduled an appointment to speak with one of their home advisors, but the conversation went nowhere. They wouldn’t explain why the comparable sales they used were so much higher than their offer, and their tone was very much “take it or leave it.” This puzzled me even further because Opendoor talks all the time about the “competitiveness” of their offers.

When I looked over their net proceeds estimate, it listed a 0.7% closing costs fee ($2,729) and a 6% service fee ($23,814). All told, the net profit was $370,357. According to them, a traditional sale of the home would only net $358,451. **Later on, I put this home on the market myself and made a net profit of $43,000 more than what they promised (more on that later)**.

Opendoor also talks about the “ease” of their offers, but that doesn’t necessarily always apply either. Case in point: When I sold a home to them last year, they came up with six repairs worth about $6,900 of work, and that home was in better condition than the home I talked about above. We haggled back and forth over each one of these repairs until I ended up hiring my own company to handle the repairs. Their estimate was just $2,900.

The bottom line is, **if you’re thinking of selling to a cash investor or a company like Opendoor, call me first** so I can outline other options that will allow you to sell more conveniently and for a higher price.

In my next video, I’ll tell you how I made a net profit of $43,000 more than what Opendoor offered for my home once I put it on the open market.

As always, if you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
