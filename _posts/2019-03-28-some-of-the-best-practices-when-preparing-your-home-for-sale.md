<center><em>Preparing a home for sale doesn&rsquo;t have to include expensive repairs or improvements. Here are our best budget-friendly tips.</em></center>

Today we’re going to give you some tips on how to get a home ready for showings on a budget. Sheri specializes in remodeling properties and is very creative about what she can do for little money. Here are a few things that she recommends.

**First impressions are important, and a buyer’s first impression of your home is the front of it**. We suggest getting that area cleared up, cleaned, and organized. It costs absolutely nothing but can make a huge difference.

Your lawn should be in good condition as well. **It should be trimmed, weeded, and pretty**. Even if you don’t have a lawn, get it seeded at least. If you don’t want to do that, I suggest taking the front of your lawn down to clean dirt. Putting mulch or red chips in your planters with some flowers can help, too.

As for the interior of the home, we all live a little cluttered. Go through every room of your home and pack 80% of what you have into boxes and take them to a garage or storage unit in one room. Pre-packing really helps. Then, you’ll want to move out as much furniture as possible from your home. **Going clutter-free is the name of the game, especially in kitchens, bathrooms, and playrooms**. Get rid of those fridge magnets, too.

The act of “defunky-ing” your house is another cheap, easy way to make it look better. If you have anything out of the ordinary, from an extension cord strewn about to any kind of “rigging,”&nbsp;**you don’t want your home to look like it’s run-down or will require a lot of work**.

Next, we suggest a deep clean of your home from top to bottom. **[&lt;&lt;&lt; &nbsp;HERE IS THE ULTIMATE CLEANING CHECKLIST . . link &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ](https://bruiser1207.wufoo.com/forms/k1hraxx402vcc63/){: target="_blank"}**&nbsp;that we give to our clients to guide them in their cleaning efforts. Buyers equate dirt and dirtiness with a home that’s in bad condition, and that’s not the kind of home they want to buy.

We offer free in-home consultations and would be glad to discuss what you can do to get your home in the best possible shape before you sell. If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
