Modern technology has brought about a lot of positive change, but it has also introduced new dangers. Today, we’ll shed some light on one such threat: wire fraud.

**Wire fraud is a common real estate scam wherein a scammer will pose as someone from a buyer’s title and escrow company in order to steal the funds they needed to close**. They achieve this by sending false wiring instructions via email, and once you’ve sent the funds to this hacker, there is no way to get them back. All too often, buyers will go ahead and send money along to scammers only to later receive a legitimate email from their title company.

This is because the emails scammers send are typically very convincing. It’s designed to mimic the real email buyers should receive when it comes time to wire their money into an escrow account prior to closing. So how do you tell the difference?

First, look closely at the email address associated with any message you receive. If the legitimate contact information for your title company is “titlecompany@escrow.net”, scammers might send you a message from an address like “titlecompany@escrow.com.” You need to keep a close eye on these little details to keep yourself and your money safe.

Next, **confirm that any wiring instructions you receive are legitimate by calling or visiting your title company in person**. Of course, if you opt to call them instead of visiting in person, make sure the phone number you call is the one listed on their website. If you use a number sent to you through an email, you may be calling a scammer, instead. Then, once you’re in touch with your escrow officer, give them your escrow account number first before your home address. If they are legitimate, they should be able to find your information based on this.

As an additional precaution, **ask your Realtor to get in touch with your title and escrow company to discuss the next steps in your transaction**, as well. It never hurts to be thorough, and working with an experienced agent who understands the value of this is key.
