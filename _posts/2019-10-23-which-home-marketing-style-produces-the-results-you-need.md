<center><em>Why do 97% of Realtors sell fewer than five homes a year? Where are the other 3%? Find out today.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Say that you invited 100 Realtors to your home to help you sell it. As they’re all walking around, checking things out, and telling you about all they can do for your house, suppose you asked them to raise their hands if they’ve sold five or more homes in the last 12 months. Only three of them would\!

The typical agent people hire is someone they know or were referred to. Those agents will put your listing in the MLS (Multiple Listing Service), put up a “for sale” sign in your yard, maybe hang some fliers, and possibly host a few open houses. Those things alone aren’t going to work. With many agents you’ll find, that’s the level of marketing you’d be stuck with.

**A key difference between the three agents and the other 97 is their use of active marketing instead of passive marketing**. To explain the difference between active and passive marketing, pretend that your home is a loaf of bread. Passive marketers will take your loaf, go over to the aisle where bread is sold, make some room on a shelf, and pop it in there. Then they’ll sit back and wait for someone to tap them on the shoulder and say, “Hey, I’d be interested in buying that loaf\!”

The problem is that there are 2,000 other loaves in the bread aisle, too\! What are the chances that someone is going to select your loaf among the many others?

An active marketer won’t just put your loaf on the shelf, but also present it to all the people walking up and down the aisle, show them all your loaf’s great qualities and ask if the people would buy it. By introducing more people to it, active marketers can generate a lot more activity and interest, thus allowing them to get it sold much faster.

If you go through a typical interview process for hiring a Realtor, you have a high chance of ending up with a passive marketer—there are just so many of them.

**Here at Hugo and Sheri Homes & Lifestyle, we offer 20 active market tools to sell your home**. The average agent has only four or five passive tools at their disposal. Over the next few weeks, we’ll walk you through our active marketing tools and show you how different they are and explain how we chase buyers down for our sellers.

In the meantime, if you’re feeling stuck in your home selling process or aren’t getting the results you’re looking for, reach out to us. We’d be more than happy to discuss your situation and find a way to flip the marketing switch from passive to active.
