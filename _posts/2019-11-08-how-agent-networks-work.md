<br>Today we’ll discuss why agent networks are one of the best active marketing tools to sell homes.

Let me tell you a story. The first week of last December I was finishing up a home sale: full-price offer, 40% down, 21-day escrow, and **when I looked at the name of the agent on the contract, I smiled**. Three weeks later we closed, right before Christmas. I called the agent, Betty, and thanked her for the offer on my listing and asked how she ended up choosing that house. I wanted to know how she went about picking my listing.

She said the buyer was defining what they wanted in a home and my listing popped into her mind. Three days after that they came out to look at one house: my listing. The rest is history. She said the reason she thinks my house popped into her mind was that my team sent her the listing every week for a month and a half, and it was the repetition that did it. Betty is just one of almost a thousand agents we’ve built relationships with over the last 38 years.

If you’re in the top 1% of agents, you’re selling 75 to 100 homes a year, and if you’re coming in from out of the area, we’re going to sponsor you. We’re going to do everything we can to do one transaction with you, then three, then five, and we’ll figure out what kind of agent you are. For example, do you sell condos or properties for horses? We have different categories of agents we work with.

As you can see, it’s not just a matter of sending information to agents—it’s about building relationships over time. Betty and I have done 17 transactions over the last six or seven years. **The reason that home sold last December is because of our great relationship**.

If you’ve been trying to sell your home in the shifting market and you’re struggling, you may want to tap into agent networks. This is one of the best tools we utilize.
