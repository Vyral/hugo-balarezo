So lets start with \#3, **Finding an agent.&nbsp;**

Many buyers never look for an agents qualifications, experience or ability. They look for someone who will do what they want, be available when they want and drive them where they want. You need to decide if you are simply looking for a YES person? Or are you looking for someone who has a deep understanding of all the buying facets?? Someone who will tell you *“I wouldn’t do it that way. . here is what I recommend”.&nbsp;*

<br>This is critical, especially when you are going to negotiate an offer on the home you’ve spent weeks searching for. Now its time to play a serious game called REAL ESTATE. So are you dealing with an agent who is well known?? someone who will get things done others cant?? Once you’ve lost your dream home because the agent you chose just didn’t have what it takes, you’ll know how important the agent you choose is (hopefully its not the family member, the church friend, or the high school buddy you are giving business to).

Getting pre qualified - step \#4 is just as critical.

&nbsp;I hear buyers say this way too often, *“I want to find the home first, then I’ll talk to a lender”.* That comment means one of the following 1 - I’m not serious about buying and am afraid I wont qualify, but since there are plenty of agents who are desperate, I’ll find one who will be willing to waste their time &nbsp;2 - I want to do it the way I want to do it, and don’t mind loosing 2-3 great homes because I never had my ducks in a row.&nbsp;

<br>So if you are NOT serious about getting the right home at the right price, do this any way you want. However, if you are SERIOUS about doing it right, get with a lender EARLY in the process. This way you know EXACTLY what its going to take to buy your home, how you qualify, how much your payments will be. Imagine finding the perfect home today, and not knowing all that stuff … three days from now when you finally have your ducks in a row, you’ll see that home be SALE PENDING and you’ll realize this is important.&nbsp;

So if you are serious and ready to find the right home. . call me at **9516437410**. . and ***I’ll be more than happy to discuss my 37 year career and put you in touch with some great lenders so I can help you get what you want. .&nbsp;***
