In today’s message, I’d like to talk about how changing markets can have varying effects on both buyers and sellers.

The last time the market peaked in 2005 and 2006, we started to notice articles that were coming out and talking about the market collapsing. In the beginning, we brushed them off, but then the articles kept coming.&nbsp;

Then we started noticing a slowdown, started seeing homes taking longer to sell, and sellers just kept doing things the same way they had done before. **It was very clear that something was changing**.

I think the reason that prices started dropping slowly is because buyers who are at the top of the market take a step back when things start to take a dip, then sellers start putting their homes on the market because they realized that they were at the peak.

I think the same thing is happening in today’s market. Prices are starting to shift because there is much more urgency for sellers to get their homes sold. When prices fall, the people who were really affected are the move-up buyers who need a bigger home and those who are getting ready to retire within the next few years. **If your home value drops significantly, you will likely be stuck, especially in this market**.

**My advice is to be preemptive and do something sooner rather than later**. If you are wondering how to attack this market and how to plan ahead to make sure that you come out on top, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
