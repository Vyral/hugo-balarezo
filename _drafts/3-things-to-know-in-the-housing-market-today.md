A lot is happening in the world, and it’s having a direct impact on the housing market. The reality is this: some of it is positive and some of it may be negative. Some we just don’t know yet.

The following three areas of the housing market are critical to understand: interest rates, building materials, and the outlook for an economic slowdown.

#### **1\. Interest Rates**

One of the most important things to consider when buying a home is the interest rate you will be charged to borrow the money. In our&nbsp;[recent post](https://www.simplifyingthemarket.com/2019/04/17/are-low-interest-rates-here-to-stay/?a=493612-8c0dbc3d035ab276a3307c7af975cf8a){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;we posed the question,&nbsp;*“Are Low Interest Rates Here To Stay?”*&nbsp;The latest information from&nbsp;[Freddie Mac](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;makes it appear they are. We are currently at a 21-month low in interest rates.

#### **2\.&nbsp;****Building Materials**

Talk of tariffs could also affect the housing market. According to a&nbsp;[recent article](https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/homebuyers-china-tariffs){: target="_blank"}, the&nbsp;*National Association of Home Builders&nbsp;*reports that as much as $10 billion in goods imported from China are used in homebuilding. Depending on the outcome of the tariff and trade discussions between several countries, there could be as much as a 25% boost in the cost of building materials.

#### **3\.&nbsp;****Economic Slowdown**

In a prior&nbsp;[blog post](https://www.simplifyingthemarket.com/2019/03/07/why-an-economic-slowdown-will-not-crush-real-estate-this-time/?a=493612-8c0dbc3d035ab276a3307c7af975cf8a){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;on this topic, we began the year with many economic leaders thinking we could expect a recession in late 2019 or early 2020. As spring approached, we&nbsp;[reported](https://www.simplifyingthemarket.com/2019/05/09/mainstream-concerns-about-an-economic-slowdown-revisited/?a=493612-8c0dbc3d035ab276a3307c7af975cf8a){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;that economists had started to push that projection past 2020.&nbsp; Now, three leading surveys indicate that it may begin in the next eighteen months.

### **Bottom Line**

We are in a strong housing market. Wages are increasing, home prices are appreciating, and mortgage rates are the lowest they have been in 21 months.&nbsp; Whether you are thinking of buying or selling, it’s a great time to be in the market.
