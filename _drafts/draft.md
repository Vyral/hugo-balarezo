Beautiful Morningstar ranch home\! Five bedrooms, four baths (one bedroom downstairs) located on a good size corner lot. This wonderful home features a big covered front porch, just perfect for a morning cup of coffee as the neighborhood wakes up.

Upon entry you will note the soaring ceilings and windows with natural light poring in. The flooring is a gorgeous wood flowing from the entry into the family room. The family room really has room for all and it is open to the kitchen with a center island, breakfast bar and tons of cabinet space. Under cabinet lighting shows off the granite counter tops. Upstairs you will find a bonus room, 4 big bedrooms and Jack & Jill bath. The master bedroom & bath are spacious and feature double sinks, bath tub and separate shower. Doing laundry is a breeze with the upstairs laundry room. And then there is the exquisite back yard.

Thousands spent on hardscape and a beautiful free form pool and spa. Energy efficient with solar power. All this and all the amenities of Morningstar Ranch such as community sport court and play ground. We invite you to come take a look\!
