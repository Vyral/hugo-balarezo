<center><em>Don’t settle for a subpar agent. Let’s discuss how to be smart when it comes to picking your representation.</em></center>

<br>I’ve been in the real estate business for 38 years and sold approximately 4,900 homes. I have a deep understanding of the local areas I work, but not every agent does.

Today you’ll see the nuts and bolts of the proven, replicable system we always use to find the right agent.

In <u><a target="_blank" href="https://homes-lifestyles.com/how-can-i-choose-the-best-agent-part-1.html">my last video</a></u>, I told you about a seller who was working with a friend. They got a quick offer, and the friend started pushing them to act fast on it. After the seller did everything they needed, they were told that the buyer ended up backing out for no reason.

All of this happened because the seller chose the wrong agent for the wrong reasons. **Let’s go over the step-by-step process of choosing an agent the right way**.

First, I jump onto a multiple listing service (MLS). Here, I’ll look at that Moreno Valley home we discussed in my last video. On that listing, we can see the identification code of the agent handling the transaction and use it to figure their production.

I then go to the “Map” tab on the MLS and generate a search by selecting a radius of 10 miles around the example property, checking “closed sales” as a criteria, and plugging in the agent’s code.

By doing so, I was able to see that that agent closed eight transactions in the last 10 years in the local market. Meanwhile, the other agent mentioned in our previous video had closed over 200 transactions in the same area during the same time frame—quite the difference, huh?

Using an MLS to compare agents is an important way to inform your decision-making process. This kind of analysis is what we bring when we meet with you. If you’re trying to decide between a couple of agents, we’ll run comparisons full of tangible data that accurately speaks to each of their performance levels.

**Remember, you’re never obligated to go with someone who isn’t the best for you.**

To give you a quick background, I’ve sold 4,900 homes, so I have a deep understanding.
