Below are four great reasons to consider buying a home today instead of waiting.

###### 1\.**P****ri****c****es** **W****ill&nbsp;****C****o****n****tinue&nbsp;****t****o&nbsp;****R****ise**

Core Logic’s latest Home Price Index reports that home prices have appreciated by 3.7% over the last 12 months. The same report predicts that prices will continue to increase at a rate of 4.8% over the next year.

Home values will continue to appreciate. Waiting may no longer make sense.

###### **2\.Mortgage Interest Rates Are Projected to Increase**

Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey\* shows that interest rates for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage have started to level off around 4.3%. Most experts predict that rates will rise over the next 12 months. The \*Mortgage Bankers Association,Fannie Mae,Freddie Mac,\* and the \*National Association of Realtors are in unison, projecting that rates will increase by this time next year.

An increase in rates will impact YOUR monthly mortgage payment. A year from now, your housing expense will increase if a mortgage is necessary to buy your next home.

###### 3\.**Either** **W****a****y****,** **Y****ou&nbsp;****A****r****e&nbsp;****P****a****ying a Mo****r****t****gage**

Some renters who have not yet purchased a home because they are uncomfortable taking on the obligation of a mortgage. Everyone should realize that unless you are living with your parents rent-free, you are paying a mortgage - *either yours or your landlord’s\*\*.*

As an owner, your mortgage payment is a form of ‘*forced\* \*savings*’ that allows you to have equity in your home that you can tap into later in life. As a renter, you guarantee your landlord is the person with that equity.

*Are you ready to put your housing cost to work for you?*

###### 4\.**I****t****’****s** **T****ime&nbsp;****t****o M****o****v****e on with** **Y****our Li****f****e**

The ‘*c**os**t*’ of a home is determined by two major components: the price of the home and the current mortgage rate. It appears that both are on the rise.

But what if they weren’t? Would you wait?

Examine the actual reason you are buying and decide if it is worth waiting. Whether you want to have a great place for your children to grow up, greater safety for your family, or you just want to have control over renovations, now could be the time to buy.

###### **I****f the rig****h****t thing&nbsp;****f****or&nbsp;****y****ou and&nbsp;****y****our family is&nbsp;****t****o pu****r****chase a home this&nbsp;****y****ea****r****, buying sooner&nbsp;****r****a****ther than l****a****t****er&nbsp;****c****ould lead&nbsp;****t****o substa****n****tial s****a****ving****s****.**
