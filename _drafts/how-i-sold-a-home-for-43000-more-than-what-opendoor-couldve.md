I sold a client’s home on the open market for $43,000 more than what they would’ve gotten selling to Opendoor.

Today is the second part of my two-part series about instant offer companies. During [part one](https://homes-lifestyles.com/what-really-happens-when-you-work-with-an-instant-offer-company.html){: target="_blank"}, I shared a story about how I tried selling a client’s home to Opendoor for cash but decided to put it on the open market instead. When I did, we sold it for $43,000 more that we would have made selling to Opendoor.

Long story short, **we listed it at $434,000 and sold it for $432,000**. The closing took about three weeks and the home was vacant the whole time, so our holding costs were minimal. Cash offer companies like Opendoor want you to think that listing on the open market is harder, but that’s not always the case. At 1:35 in the video above, I’ve provided a thumbnail gallery of the home in question.

To recap, Opendoor’s offer was $396,000. In their net proceeds estimate, it listed a 0.7% closing costs fee ($2,729), a 6% service fee ($23,814), a 2% seller concessions fee ($7,936), and a 1% holding costs fee ($3,969). All told, the net profit was $370,357, but after we subtracted an additional $5,000 repair fee, the total was $365,357. According to them, a traditional sale of the home would only net $358,451.

Here are the numbers we subtracted from the actual $432,000 sale:

* Closing costs: $3,222
* Commission fee: $19,444
* Seller concessions: $0
* Holding costs fee: $950

From that, our net profit was $408,383—$43,027 more than what we would’ve made with Opendoor.

The lesson, again, is that **if you’re thinking of selling to a cash investor or a company like Opendoor, call me first** so I can outline other options that will allow you to sell more conveniently and for a higher price. You may end up walking away with a lot more money than you thought just by selling on the open market.

As always, if you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
