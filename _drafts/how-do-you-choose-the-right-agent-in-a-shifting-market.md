When it comes to hiring an agent in a shifting market, there’s only one type of production that matters.

How do you hire the right agent in a shifting market?

There are some common habits among sellers who struggle selling their homes in this type of environment, and **one of those is hiring an agent simply because they already know them**. I rarely hear a seller say they chose an agent because that agent sells the most houses in their area.

Just the other day, I interviewed with a seller who was interviewing two other agents. We did a production analysis for this client, and it showed that the first agent had sold zero houses in the last five years. The second agent had sold a total of four homes over that time period, but none in the last year. My team and I, meanwhile, have closed 212 transactions in the last five years.

This production analysis made them realize an important point all sellers should know: **In a shifting market, you should choose an agent who has the best track record of homes sales in your area over the past five to eight years**. That’s the only type of production that matters, and it comes from agents who use active marketing (actively pursuing buyers, prospecting, following up with leads, etc.) instead of passive marketing.

Another way to understand the difference is to look at how agents act during an “up” market. Being an agent in an “up” market is like a swimmer riding the current—no matter what you do, homes will sell. Once the market shifts, though, the agents who were just riding the current will be out of the business because they can’t adapt. This is especially important to you because in a “down” market, the longer your home stays listed, the less you’ll profit from its sale.

So when you’re in the process of hiring an agent to sell your home, do your homework. On that note, I’d be happy to do a production analysis for you and refer you to the most productive agents in your area.
